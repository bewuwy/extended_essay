## TODO

- change citation style to APA
- add x, y labels to graphs

## Work plan

### introduction
- idk man sth

### square bridge
- [x] finding polar form - straight line times 4
- [x] finding relation between road and ”wheel”
- [x] get y(t), then find road equation in y(x) form
- [x] catenary road = -cosh x

### rounded square
 - [x] why rounded - gears teeth
 - [x] why rounded corners are hard - rolling on a circle, but centre of mass is outside of it
- [x] polar form of a rounded corner
- [-] symbolic solution
- - definite integration
- - elliptic integral of 2nd kind
- - cant get y(x)
- [x] numerical solution

### real bridge
- setting centre of mass to be at geometric centre (adding additional weight at the top of the bridge)
- find location of gear teeth - roll the track around and trace intersection with bridge - inverse transformation of track around the bridge
- calculating work needed to be done to roll the bridge - the centre of mass is actually 2inches below the geometric centre

### triangle bridge
- [x] normally cannot - too steep road and triangle crashes, but with rounded corners its possible
- the catenary curve is steeper, so more friction is needed

### polygonal bridge
- pentagon and hexagon

### conclusion
- idk man

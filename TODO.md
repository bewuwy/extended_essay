## TODO

- [x] change citation style to APA
- [x] add x, y labels to graphs

## Work plan

### introduction
- [x] idk man sth

### square bridge
- [x] finding polar form - straight line times 4
- [x] finding relation between road and ”wheel”
- [x] get y(t), then find road equation in y(x) form
- [x] catenary road = -cosh x

### rounded square
 - [x] why rounded - gears teeth
 - [x] why rounded corners are hard - rolling on a circle, but centre of mass is outside of it
- [x] polar form of a rounded corner
- [-] (not possible) symbolic solution - not possible
- [x] numerical solution

### real bridge
- setting centre of mass to be at geometric centre (adding additional weight at the top of the bridge)
- [x] find location of gear teeth - roll the track around and trace intersection with bridge - inverse transformation of track around the bridge
- calculating work needed to be done to roll the bridge - the centre of mass is actually 2inches below the geometric centre

### triangle bridge
- [x] normally cannot - too steep road and triangle crashes, but with rounded corners its possible
- [x] the catenary curve is steeper, so more friction is needed

### polygonal bridge
- [x] pentagon and hexagon

### conclusion
- [x] idk man

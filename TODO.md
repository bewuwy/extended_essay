## Work plan
- [x] square bridge
- - [x] simple rolling square
- - - [x] finding polar form - straight line times 4
- - - [x] finding relation between road and ”wheel”
- - -  [x] get y(t), then find road equation in y(x) form
- - - [x] catenary road = -cosh x
- - [x] rounded square
- - - [x] why rounded - gears teeth
- - - [x] why rounded corners are hard - rolling on a circle, but centre of mass is outside of it
- - - [x] calculating road for the rounded square
- - - - [x] polar form of a rounded corner
- - - - [-] symbolic solution
- - - - - definite integration
- - - - - elliptic integral of 2nd kind
- - - - - cant get y(x)
- - - - numerical solution
- - - setting centre of mass to be at geometric centre (adding additional weight at the top of the bridge)
- - - find location of gear teeth - roll the track around and trace intersection with bridge - inverse transformation of track around the bridge
- - - calculating work needed to be done to roll the bridge - the centre of mass is actually 2inches below the geometric centre
- triangle bridge
- - normally cannot - too steep road and triangle crashes, but with rounded corners its possible
- - the catenary curve is steeper, so more friction is needed
- polygonal bridge
- - pentagon and hexagon
- conclusion
